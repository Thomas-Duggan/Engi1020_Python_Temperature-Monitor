## Note
"CFW" means Custom FirmWare. I do not have permission to distribute the CFW used.


## Purpose

Requests input for a temperature threshold and activates buzzer when threshold is met or surpassed.
Also tells weather on LCD display.


## Issues

 - Not enough testing.
 - Often shows "NOT ENOUGH DATA" when it shouldn't.
 - I don't like the text blinking on the LCD display.
